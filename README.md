I made this project on high school. It helped my classmates to not ask the notes to copy the matter, it also kept them informed about the tasks deadlines and showed teachers and headteacher notices.

It was in my very begining at learning web stuffs so it is totally impractible, I mean, it is entirely in HTML and CSS.

I wont be working in this repo again. I'm really proud of what I did, even if it is simple.

## Usage

It's deployed with the GitHub Pages, so [check it out](https://pages.github.com/).

If you wanna use it for any crazy reason, just clone this repo and open the ```index.html``` file.
